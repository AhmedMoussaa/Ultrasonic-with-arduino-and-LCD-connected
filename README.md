Hello


in this respitory i will show the Ultrasonic sensor connected with an Arduino and 1 servo motor

where if the distance is 15 cm and for over 3 seconds the LCD will print out "Hello how can i help you?" 

and the servo motor will rotate where if it is connected to an arm it will basically move the arm and say hello in real life too
